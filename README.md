# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using a structured retail transaction dataset. The objective is to uncover insights into customer demographics, purchasing habits, subscription behavior, discount impact, and product performance. The project integrates Python for data processing, SQL for business analysis, and Power BI for interactive visualization, making it a complete end-to-end data analytics portfolio project.

**Dataset Summary**

**Total Records**: 3,900 rows

**Total Features**: 18 columns

**Key Attributes**:

**Customer demographics**: age, gender, location, subscription_status

**Purchase details**: item_purchased, category, purchase_amount, color, size, season

**Shopping behavior**: discount_applied, promo_code_used, previous_purchases, frequency_of_purchases, review_rating, shipping_type

**Missing Data**:

37 missing values found in review_rating, handled during preprocessing

**Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python**
**1. Data Loading**

The dataset was loaded using Pandas into a DataFrame for analysis.

**2. Initial Exploration**

.info() was used to inspect data types and structure

.describe() was used to understand statistical distribution

**3. Missing Data Handling**

Missing values in the review_rating column were imputed using the median rating grouped by product category, ensuring logical consistency.

**4. Column Standardization**

All column names were converted into snake_case format for better readability and consistency.

**5. Feature Engineering**

Created a new column age_group by binning customers into:

Young Adult

Middle-Aged

Adult

Senior

Transformed purchase frequency into a structured format for analysis.

**6. Data Consistency Check**

Verified if discount_applied and promo_code_used were redundant.

Found overlapping information and removed the promo_code_used column.

**7. Database Integration**

Cleaned dataset was exported from Python and loaded into PostgreSQL for running SQL-based analysis.

**Data Analysis Using SQL**

**Revenue by Gender**

Compared total revenue generated by male and female customers.

**High-Spending Discount Users**

Identified customers who used discounts but still spent above the average purchase amount.

**Top 5 Products by Rating**

Ranked products based on highest average customer ratings.

**Shipping Type Comparison**

Compared average purchase value between Standard and Express shipping.

**Subscribers vs Non-Subscribers**

Analyzed total customers, average spend, and total revenue for both groups.

**Discount-Dependent Products**

Identified products that relied heavily on discounts for sales volume.

**Customer Segmentation**

Segmented customers based on age group, gender, and spending level.

**Top 3 Products per Category**

Found the best-performing products in each category based on revenue.

**Repeat Buyers & Subscriptions**

Checked whether customers with more than 5 purchases were more likely to be subscribers.

**Revenue by Age Group**

Measured revenue contribution of each age category.

**Power BI Dashboard**

An interactive Customer Behavior Dashboard was created using Power BI that includes:

Total Customers (3.9K)

Average Review Rating (3.75)

Average Purchase Amount ($59.76)

Revenue by Category

Sales by Category

Subscription Distribution

Revenue by Age Group

Sales by Age Group

Dynamic slicers for:

Gender

Category

Shipping Type

Subscription Status

This dashboard allows real-time business insight exploration.

**Key Results & Insights**

Clothing category generated the highest overall revenue and sales.

Non-subscribers made up the majority of customers, but subscribers had higher average spending.

Express shipping customers showed a slightly higher purchase value.

Young adults and middle-aged customers contributed the highest revenue.

High repeat buyers showed strong alignment with subscription adoption.

**Business Recommendations**
**1. Boost Subscriptions**

Offer early access, loyalty discounts, and exclusive deals to convert non-subscribers.

**2. Customer Loyalty Programs**

Reward repeat buyers with loyalty points, referral benefits, and tier-based offers.

**3. Review Discount Policy**

Optimize discount usage to improve profitability while maintaining sales volume.

**4. Product Positioning**

Promote top-rated and top-revenue products more aggressively in campaigns.

**5. Targeted Marketing**

Focus marketing budgets on high-revenue age groups and express-shipping users.
